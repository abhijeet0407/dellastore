Manage your Woocommerce product categories easily with this flexible Category Tree plugin

== Description ==
With the Product Category Tree plugin, you can now manage your Woocommerce product categories in a tree structure. This gives you a much better overview of your product categories - especially if you have a large amount of product categories with children.

The tree structure makes it easy to find the category you are searching for, as you simply expand and collapse the parent categories.

We have even added a drag ‘n’ drop functionality that makes it easy for you to change the order of your product categories.

**Main features:**

* Sort categories via drag ‘n’ drop
* Expand and collapse categories for a better overview
* ‘Expand all’ and ‘Collapse all’ available
* Quick edit to change name and slug
* Supports an unlimited number of categories and subcategories

Compatible with Woocommerce 2.5 and higher.

**Now available in the pro version!**

* Tree structure for product categories also available when you create/edit products
* Disable an entire product category in one click

**[Read more about the pro version here](http://togidata.dk/en/product-category-tree/)**
